# Clustering Experiments
 Some experimentation on cluster analysis using k-means algorithm.

 Currently including clusterization of:

- *Books*, based on average rating on Goodreads and number of pages.
- *Countries*, based on GDP and population as of 2022.
- *Movies*, based on average rating on MovieLens and total revenue.
